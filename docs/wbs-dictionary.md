# Work Breakdown Structure (WBS) and Dictionary for the AI-Assisted Fitness Platform

This combined file provides the hierarchical Work Breakdown Structure **(WBS)** and a full **WBS Dictionary** so that a solo developer can move from a blank code editor to a fully-deployed prototype ready to demo to personal trainers and gyms.

> **Tip for AI coding assistants:**  Treat every *Associated Activity* bullet as a discrete prompt you can feed directly into ChatGPT, Copilot, or similar tools to generate code, configurations, or documentation.
