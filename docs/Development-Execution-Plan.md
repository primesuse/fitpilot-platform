export async function requireActiveSubscription(request: NextRequest) {
const session = await getServerSession(authOption
) if (!session?.user || session.user.userType !== 'pt
) { return { authorized: false, reason: 'Unautho

const trainer = await prisma.personalTrainer.findUnique({
where: { email: session.user.email
}, select: { subscriptionStatus: true, subscriptionExpiresAt

if (!trainer || trainer.subscriptionStatus !== 'active' ||
trainer.subscriptionExpiresAt < new Da
e()) { return { authorized: false, reason: 'Subscription

return { authorized: true, trainer }

#### 5.2 Progress Photo Storage Strategy
// Photo upload handling
export async function uploadProgressPhoto(
clientId: strin
, photoType: 'front' | 'side' | 'b
ck', fil
: F
le ) { // Upload to AWS S3 or C
oudinary const uploadResult = await uploadToStor
progress-photos/${clientId},
transformation: { width: 800, height: 1200, crop: 'limi

// Save to database
return await prisma.progressPhoto.create
{ d
ta: {
${photoType}ImageUrl]: uploadResult.secure_url,
weekNumber: calculateWeekNumber(clie
tId), capturedAt
