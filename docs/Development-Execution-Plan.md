# Development Execution Plan
## AI-Assisted Fitness Platform

### 1. Technology Stack
| Layer | Tool / Framework | Notes |
|-------|------------------|-------|
| Frontend | React (Next.js) | Component-based UI, SSR support |
| Backend | Node.js + Express | RESTful API, shared JS ecosystem |
| Database | PostgreSQL (Dev: SQLite) | Robust relational DB |
| ORM | Prisma | Schema-first development |
| AI | OpenAI GPT API | Chat, program suggestions |
| Payments | Stripe | PCI-compliant processing |
| Auth | NextAuth.js | Social + email auth |
| Storage | AWS S3 | Photos, video uploads |
| Hosting | Vercel (frontend) / Render (backend) | CI/CD from GitHub |

### 2. Development Workflow
1. **Version Control**: Initialize Git repo; push to GitHub.
2. **Project Board**: Create Trello board: To-Do, In-Progress, Review, Done.
3. **Branching**: Feature branches → Pull Requests → Main branch.
4. **Code Style**: ESLint + Prettier, Husky pre-commit hooks.
5. **Continuous Integration**: GitHub Actions for lint/test/build.

### 3. UI/UX Process
| Step | Deliverable | Tool |
|------|-------------|------|
| Wireframes | Low-fi page layouts | Figma |
| Mockups | High-fi designs | Figma |
| Component Library | Reusable UI kit | Storybook |

### 4. Milestone Schedule (12-Week Solo Timeline)
| Week | Goal |
|------|------|
| 1 | Environment setup, ERD in Prisma, auth scaffold |
| 2-3 | Core backend: PT & Client CRUD, JWT, Prisma migrations |
| 4-5 | Frontend auth pages, public site, PT dashboard skeleton |
| 6-7 | Workout program builder, exercise library CRUD, AI helper MVP |
| 8 | Meal plan builder, food API integration |
| 9 | Messaging system (Socket.io), file uploads to S3 |
| 10 | Payments via Stripe, calendar booking module |
| 11 | Achievements engine, fun metrics, notifications |
| 12 | Testing, polish, deploy to Vercel/Render, demo video |

### 5. Testing Strategy
- **Unit Tests**: Jest for utilities & components.
- **API Tests**: Supertest + Postman collection.
- **E2E Tests**: Cypress for critical flows (login, program logging).
- **Manual QA**: Weekly usability sweeps.

### 6. Deployment & DevOps
- **CI/CD**: Auto-deploy main branch to Vercel/Render.
- **Env Secrets**: GitHub Secrets → Vercel env vars.
- **Database Migrations**: Prisma migrate deploy hook.
- **Monitoring**: LogRocket (frontend) + Logtail (backend logs).

### 7. Post-Launch Tasks
- Collect PT feedback via Typeform.
- Prioritize roadmap features (mobile app, community).
- Prepare marketing site SEO & content.

This plan transforms requirements into an actionable roadmap for a solo developer, aligning tools, timeline, and best practices to deliver a functional prototype ready for pitching to trainers and gyms.
